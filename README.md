# Business Process Optimization (Lean Six Sigma / DMAIC) — Gentech Case Study

Lean Six Sigma (DMAIC) process optimization case study — reduced proposal cycle time **15%** across **5 global regions**.

## Business Problem
Gentech’s proposal creation process faced delays and rework, causing frequent SLA misses and impacting revenue performance.

## Goal
Improve SLA adherence (target: **95% within 35 days**) by reducing proposal cycle time by **15%**.

## Scope & Data
- Coverage: **5 global regions**
- Volume analyzed: **75,000** proposal transactions
- Key bottlenecks identified: **ZQT6 / ZQT8** process steps

## Approach (What I Did)
- Mapped the end-to-end workflow and separated value vs non-value steps (**VA/NVA**)
- Identified defect drivers and delay root causes using **Pareto + Fishbone (RCA)**
- Assessed risk points using **FMEA** and prioritized improvements by impact/effort

## Key Recommendations
- Standardized intake fields/templates to prevent incomplete submissions and rework
- Introduced low-risk auto-approvals / approval thresholds to reduce waiting time
- Added pre-check validation and KPI monitoring to prevent defects and sustain improvements

## Results
- **15% cycle time reduction**
- Improved SLA adherence and reduced delay drivers in bottleneck steps (**ZQT6 / ZQT8**)
